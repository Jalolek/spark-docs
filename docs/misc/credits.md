spark has two profiler "engines":
* The `async` engine is a wrapper around [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) by [apangin](https://github.com/apangin).
* The `built-in java` engine is an improved version of the [WarmRoast](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) profiler by [sk89q](https://github.com/sk89q).

The spark-viewer user interface is based on the original WarmRoast UI, with a number of changes and improvements made over the years. The most significant of which was a re-write using the React framework, contributed by [astei](https://github.com/astei/).

Thanks to all the other contributors to [spark](https://github.com/lucko/spark/graphs/contributors), [spark-viewer](https://github.com/lucko/spark-viewer/graphs/contributors) and [spark-docs](https://github.com/lucko/spark-docs/graphs/contributors) who have made pull requests on GitHub.

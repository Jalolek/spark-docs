spark was originally a fork of the excellent [WarmRoast](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) profiler by [sk89q](https://github.com/sk89q). The project would not exist if it wasn't for the work originally completed there.

The spark-viewer user interface is based on the original WarmRoast UI, with a number of changes and improvements made over the years. The most significant of which was a re-write using the React framework, contributed by [astei](https://github.com/astei/).

And finally, thanks to all the other contributors to [spark](https://github.com/lucko/spark/graphs/contributors), [spark-viewer](https://github.com/lucko/spark-viewer/graphs/contributors) and [spark-docs](https://github.com/lucko/spark-docs/graphs/contributors) who have made pull requests on GitHub.
